## Node and NPM version

TL;DR

- Node version: 18.18.2
- npm version: 9.8.1

For now, **API breaks with Node > 18.18**. Node 18.18.2 is required.

Also, Node 18.18.2 comes with npm 9.8.1, so the project should work properly with it. In any case, npm workspaces were added in npm 7.0.0, so you should have at least that version (9.8.1 strongly recommended).

## Useful information if you fork this monorepo

### Package lock is git ignored

Intended in order to avoid merge conflicts on this repo

**Don't forget to remove it from git ignore!**
Package versions should always be defined specifically (without the simbol ^)
This ensures that even if the lock is deleted, same versions would be reinstalled.

Having the lock inside your repo is useful for CI package caching and to avoid version diff on fresh install.

### Github workflow is deactivated

We don't want to trigger the workflow here, but you probably want to.
You should rename the .github/workflows-off folder to **.github/workflow**
